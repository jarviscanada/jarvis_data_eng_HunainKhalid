summary: "I am a recent graduate from York University's Computer Science program. I specialize in software development, including full-stack development, compiler-level coding and machine learning. Although proficient, I continue to improve my skills in Docker, Java, SQL, Python, React.js, Git, Linux and more. As a full-stack software developer, I solve problems quickly, with optimized run time and extensive documentation. A course on computer security helped with enterprise-level solutions to computer security and security at the programming level. I am also an excellent communicator, team member and leader. Currently employed at Jarvis, I improve my skills through challenging projects and team collaboration in an agile environment."
