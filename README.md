# Hunain Khalid . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from York University's Computer Science program. I specialize in software development, including full-stack development, compiler-level coding and machine learning. Although proficient, I continue to improve my skills in Docker, Java, SQL, Python, React.js, Git, Linux and more. As a full-stack software developer, I solve problems quickly, with optimized run time and extensive documentation. A course on computer security helped with enterprise-level solutions to computer security and security at the programming level. I am also an excellent communicator, team member and leader. Currently employed at Jarvis, I improve my skills through challenging projects and team collaboration in an agile environment.

**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HunainKhalid/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux cluster monitoring agent to monitor and analyze server hardware usage in real-time using Bash scripts, PostgreSQL, and Docker. Crontab was added and collected system information per minute using Bash scripts. Used DBeaver to monitor database insertions in real-time. Version control is done through Git and Github. SQL queries report average server usage via gathered data from Bash scripts for data analytic purposes.
